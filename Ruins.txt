Based with Grey Seer spray.
Then a couple of coats of thinned Sons of Horus.
Then Agrax Earthshade, then dry-brush with Celestra Grey.
As some of the edges arenâ€™t that sharp (3D printing and all that) I had to re-edge highlight some of the brick with Celestra grey.
Skulls Wraithbone/Skeleton Horde with highlights.
