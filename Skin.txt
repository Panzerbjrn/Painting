Comment 1:
Thanks!

I wrote a comment in this thread and loosely detailed the process here.

I'm struggling to recall the paints I used during each step because I generally just throw down a bunch of skin tones on my palette and paint by eye using various mixes. But I can tell you that these would have been on the palette:

Scale75:
Light Skin Tone
Golden Skin Tone
Basic Flesh
Pink Flesh
African Shadow
Indian Shadow

Vallejo Model Color
Hull Red

Citadel
Bugman's Glow

If I'm being honest, It's really hard to give tips for the skin because I'm still so unsure of the process myself. I generally just start with a base coat using my mid tone, and then slap some dark shadow and bright highlight colours in the places where I want it to be. I don't even try to be neat at this point. It will look awful, just accept it.

I then just start layering and glazing until it looks good haha.

I usually get to a point where I'm happy with the colours, but it doesn't look smooth, and the blends are too stark. Once I reach this point I try and do an all-over glaze using a colour that leans more towards the mid tone. I Find this helps to normalise the blends and smooth things out. Sometimes that will reduce the contrast of my highlights and shadows, so I build them back up a little, then glaze over them again. Repeat until I'm happy.

I hope that helps, sorry I can't be more specific. I'm still learning myself.
