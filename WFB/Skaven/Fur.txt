Contrast paint.
Black Templar, Wildwood, Gore-Grunta Fur, Basilicanum Grey, and Gryph-Hound Orange for some ginger rats.
Basically any pots of paint on my shelf that could be fur colours.
I usually don't highlight the fur, but when I do, I just use the original contrast paint and a little bit of white mixed in.


Skaven have variations between black and light brown. bigger and stronger skaven tend to have darker fur. so clanrats have shades of brown mostly.
Clan rictus clanrats have relatively dark fur, i mix the browns from a bone tone,
a regular standard brown and sometimes black, because the fur color doesnt need to be the same all the time.
agrax earthshade and ready, i dont highlight regular rats afterwards.


To give my clan rat slightly different tones I abuse underpainting.
I prime them with various really dark color (dark blue, dark red, dark brown)
 and dry brush them with various mid tone (greys, browns, oranges, yellows) before going to town with the fur color (I don't use contrast, but that should work too).
 That way, they are really cohesive but all have slightly different colors.
