See post for images.

Step 1: basecoat Rakarth Flesh
Step 2: 1:3 Druchii violet and Medium all over
Step 3: Layer Flayed one flesh
Step 4: Highligt slowly with very thinned Pallid Wych flesh. Gonna look bad at first but trust trust the process.
Step 5: 1:3 Carroburg Crimson and Medium on places like Mouth/ear/nose/palm and under food.

slowly build it up and highlight again after with Pallid W Flesh.
Tail needs another Druchii shade like the first mix. All over it. Then build up with crimson shade Mix towards the end.

 Kislev flesh as a base and Rakarth flesh for the raised bits with citadel paints. thats me just eyeballing it though

 When I do a zombie-ish skin tone like this I use rakarth flesh as the base and wash in either carroburg crimson (Iâ€™ve got that on my stormfiends on my profile) or with reikland flesh shade which may be what they used here for the slightly warmer areas and shadows. Highlight could be more rakarth flesh and then maybe wraithbone for the sharper highlights?

 Kislev flesh or cadian fleshtone base coat. Drybrush of one of the pale fleshtones.

Looks like Kislev as a base and pallid wych flesh for the highlights with a good blend

I do pale skintone on my skaven as follows: Base cadian fleshtone, wash with reikland fleshshade, again cadian fleshtone, 50/50 cadian fleshtone/kislev flesh, kislev flesh, 50/50 kislev flesh/flayed-one flesh and then edge highlight with flayed-one flesh.
I've posted a skitter with this recipe, so you can compare if it's the right brightness for you
Edit: could be that they used rakarth flesh, reikland fleshshade and pallid wychflesh here
