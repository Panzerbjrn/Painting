Here's a good link for painting plate armor: :ph34r:

Don't forget, that there is also lacquered armour !
This is really easy to do; Just follow the steps on the link for black lined armour, but instead of using boltgun metal as a highlight for the raised areas, use the brightest gold you have. After you finished that, give the whole thing a gloss varnish coat. And there you have it! :happy:

Speaking of colour choices, it was an issue I spent a while pondering.  The Knights Panther are supposed to be a fairly wealthy secular order, so I used a lot more gold detailing on the armour, on the fluting and on visors etc.  I think they contrast nicely with the more austere and uniform Reiksgard.

Although generally painted with a blue appearance these days, this order's earliest appearances used black and gold themes, starting with John Blanche's well known painting, and then onto their first appearance as a well described unit in the 3rd edition army list published in White Dwarf.  The blue colouring seems to have started to appear when they were first sold as a boxed unit for Warhammer 4th edition, and has stuck ever since.  In the end I went with the blue theme as a contrast to my other Empire units (which mostly use the black and yellow of Averland) and because, well, I just like the colour!
