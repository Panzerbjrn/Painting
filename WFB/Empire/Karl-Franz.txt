Okay, so for the bird parts it's ProAcryl Burnt Sienna as the base, and then darkened with Burnt umber, or brightened as needed with orange and yellow ochre.
The cream is small bits of yellow ochre and Sienna in a majority of pale yellow!
For the tiger end, same cream, orange and yellow ochre and the black stripes are the umber mixed with Payne's Grey!
Hope that helps. Edit: claws and beak start with Payne's Grey and work up
