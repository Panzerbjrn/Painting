Swordmaster - Takeda Samurai

The undercoat primer is a 2 part Zenithal
So spray completely black, then only from high angles, spray white until there is a perfect white surface on all of the high points, leaving transition shading on the low points.

The armour is an even coat of Blood Angels Red Contrast paint creates the bold colour.
The cloth (arm, skirt) is painted with Black Templar contrast and all of the trim with Black Legion Contrast.

IMPORTANT TO NOTE: contrasts dry quickly and are translucent, so for the red you must paint it swiftly and evenly, as once it dries its hard to match without further darkening the already painted areas.

Balthazar Gold for metal parts in bronze.
Stormhost Silver for the blade.

Helmet plume and gems are Shyish Purple as a base.
Then to finish the gems, layer up with a selection of purple to blue. Finishing up with a few small specs of pure white to form fake reflections.

The warrior's hair (you can't see it in the image) was done with Aggaros Dunes to make a nice rich blonde colour.

The finishing touch for the red armour is a generous amount of Nuln Oil over the whole model, completing the lacquered metal look. I applied significantly more to the bronze to add more depth.

The final step is cleanup and adding thin lines of black legion between armour plates with a very fine brush to break up the lines and make it seem less static.

Hope this helps! I look forward to seeing your version of this formula :)
