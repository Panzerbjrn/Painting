Me:
Which green(s) did you use on the quiver? It looks very vibrant.
Which colours did you use for the leather straps across the chest?

OP:
For the wings on the quiver I used Citadel Contrast Nagdreg Yellow on the inner and Warp Lightning on the outer.
These were highlighted with P3 Mouldy Ochre and P3 Necrotite Green respectively.
The straps are Army Painter Speedpaint Hardened Leather highlighted with P3 Tan.
